Creating a script with characters can make the concept more relatable and easier to understand. Here's a script featuring four characters: Alice (bank customer), Bob (bank IT manager), Carol (bank compliance officer), and Dave (bank customer service representative).

### Scene 1: Alice's Concern
**(Alice is sitting at her computer, looking worried. She decides to call the bank's customer service.)**

**Alice:** (on the phone) Hi, this is Alice. I’m concerned about the safety of my bank account. I’ve been reading about data breaches, and I want to make sure my account is secure.

**Dave:** (on the phone) Hi Alice, I understand your concern. Our bank takes data security very seriously. Let me connect you to Bob, our IT manager, who can explain how we protect your information.

### Scene 2: Explaining Access Management
**(Bob, the IT manager, joins the call.)**

**Bob:** Hi Alice, this is Bob. I’m the IT manager here. We have robust security measures in place, including access management tools like SailPoint.

**Alice:** That’s good to hear, but can you tell me more about how these tools work?

**Bob:** Sure. Access management tools help us control who has access to what information. They ensure that only authorized employees can access your account details.

**Alice:** But I heard you’re also developing an in-house tool. Isn’t that redundant?

---

### Scene 3: The Need for an In-House Tool
**(Carol, the compliance officer, joins the conversation.)**

**Carol:** Hi Alice, this is Carol, the compliance officer. Our in-house tool is designed to complement SailPoint by providing additional customization for our specific needs. 

**Bob:** Exactly. While SailPoint is great, our in-house tool allows us to tailor the interface and workflows to better fit our bank’s processes. This means we can handle unique situations more efficiently.

---

### Scene 4: Benefits of the In-House Tool
**(Alice looks more relaxed as she listens.)**

**Alice:** That sounds promising. How does this help with data safety?

**Carol:** Our in-house tool enhances security by making it easier for employees to follow proper protocols. It reduces the risk of human error, which is a common cause of data breaches.

**Bob:** Plus, it streamlines the recertification process. This means we regularly review and update access permissions, ensuring that only the right people have access to sensitive information.

**Alice:** So, it’s not just about having a tool but about making sure it fits your needs perfectly and works efficiently.

---

### Scene 5: Customer Assurance
**(Dave wraps up the call.)**

**Dave:** That’s right, Alice. By using both SailPoint and our in-house tool, we’re making sure your data is as safe as possible. We want to assure you that your security is our top priority.

**Alice:** Thank you, everyone. I feel much better knowing you’re taking these extra steps to protect my information.

---

### Scene 6: Post-Call Discussion
**(After the call, Bob and Carol discuss the recertification tool.)**

**Bob:** Carol, I think our explanation went well. Alice seemed reassured.

**Carol:** Definitely. It’s important to convey that our in-house tool isn’t about redundancy but about enhancing and customizing our security measures to better protect our customers.

**Bob:** Agreed. It’s all about providing the best possible protection and user experience.
